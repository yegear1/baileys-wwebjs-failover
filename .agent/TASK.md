## Active Task

### 📌 Task [01.6]: Redis Queue Integration & Deduplication Lock

- **Description:** Implement Redis queue consumers and producers connecting to `whatsapp:receive:inbox` (inbound message queue) and `whatsapp:send:priority` (outbound dispatch queue), with distributed atomic deduplication lock (`SET NX EX 300`), at-most-once delivery guarantee, graceful backpressure, and worker error recovery.
- **Systems Involved:** `redis`, `queues`, `orchestrator`, `dedup`
- **Action Type:**
  - [ ] Read-only / Documentation
  - [x] Source code changes
- **Status:** READY FOR PLANNING
  *(Workflow: `READY FOR PLANNING` → `PLANNING` on presenting plan → approval → `RUNNING`)*

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Implement Redis queue manager connecting to `whatsapp:receive:inbox` and `whatsapp:send:priority`.
- [ ] Atomic deduplication lock using Redis `SET dedupe:msg:<hash> 1 NX EX 300` before pushing to `whatsapp:receive:inbox`.
- [ ] Outbound priority queue worker consuming from `whatsapp:send:priority` via `BLPOP` and dispatching via `FailoverOrchestrator.sendMessage()`.
- [ ] Graceful buffering and pause during orchestrator failover state transitions (`FENCING`, `COLD_START_STANDBY`, `RECOVERY_SWAP`).
- [ ] Strict type checking passing with zero `any` (`pnpm typecheck` exits 0).
- [ ] Automated tests passing (`pnpm test` exits 0).
- [ ] Linter and format checks passing (`pnpm lint` exits 0).
- [ ] Build passes cleanly (`pnpm build` exits 0).

## Backlog (Upcoming, in priority order)

- [ ] **[02.1]** **Dual-Device QR Pairing & Granular Health API** — HTTP endpoints for pairing both sessions independently (`GET /qr/baileys`, `GET /qr/wwebjs`) and reporting multi-engine health (`GET /health`).

## Release / Cycle Wrap-up (Not the next task)

Release/tag only with explicit human request. When triggered, the ID is `[99.1]`. Do not number feature, hygiene, or CI tasks as `99.x`. Do not calculate next task ID from this section.

---

## How to Keep this File Lean

1. Detail only in the active task. When complete $\rightarrow$ log one line and promote the next task.
2. Backlog is a list of titles. Full spec only when an item becomes the active task.
3. Next ID = last ID in log (or active task). Cycle wrap-up and `[99.1]`: see `AGENTS.md`.
